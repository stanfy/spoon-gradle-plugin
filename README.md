Spoon Gradle Plugin
===================

Gradle plugin for [Spoon](https://github.com/square/spoon).
Allows you to run spoon with almost no effort under new Android build system.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin)

Plugin generates `spoon${TEST_VARIANT}` tasks for every test variation in your application project.

Usage
-----
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.stanfy.spoon:spoon-gradle-plugin:0.9.3'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'spoon'

// This section is optional
spoon {
  // for debug output
  debug = true

  // If enabled, will create tasks for running subsets of all tests -
  // one for each test size annotation (@SmallTest, @MediumTest, @LargeTest)
  useTestSizes = true

  // To run a single test class
  className = 'fully.qualified.TestCase'

  // To run a single method in TestCase
  methodName = 'testMyApp'
}
```

After applying the plugin you'll find `spoon${TEST_VARIANT}` tasks in your project.

You may run all the test variations with
```
gradle spoon
```

Generated reports are available at `build/spoon/${TEST_VARIANT}` folder.

For making screenshots add `spoon-client` dependency to your tests compile configuration:
```groovy
dependencies {

  instrumentTestCompile 'com.squareup.spoon:spoon-client:1.1.0'

}
```

By default the plugin runs tests on all the connected devices.
In order to run them on some concrete devices instead, you may specify their serial numbers:
```
spoon {
  devices = ['333236E9AE5800EC']
}
```

You may also setup your project to take parameters for class/method to be run from command line. E.g.:

```bash
gradle spoon -PspoonClassName=fully.qualified.TestCase
```

And project configuration:

```groovy
spoon {
  if (project.hasProperty('spoonClassName')) {
    className = project.spoonClassName  
  }
}
```
