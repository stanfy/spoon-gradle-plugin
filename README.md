Spoon Gradle Plugin
===================

Gradle plugin for [Spoon](https://github.com/square/spoon).
Allows you to run spoon with almost no effort under new Android build system.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin)

Plugin generates `spoon${TEST_VARIANT}` tasks for every test variation in your application project.

Usage
-----
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.stanfy.spoon:spoon-gradle-plugin:1.0.2'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'spoon'

// This section is optional
spoon {
  // for debug output
  debug = true

  // To run a single test class
  className = 'fully.qualified.TestCase'

  // To run a single method in TestCase
  methodName = 'testMyApp'
}
```

After applying the plugin you'll find `spoon${TEST_VARIANT}` tasks in your project.

You may run all the test variations with
```
gradle spoon
```

Generated reports are available at `build/spoon/${TEST_VARIANT}` folder.

For making screenshots add `spoon-client` dependency to your tests compile configuration:
```groovy
dependencies {
  androidTestCompile 'com.squareup.spoon:spoon-client:1.1.9'
}
```
Device Selection
-------------
By default the plugin runs tests on all the connected devices.
In order to run them on some concrete devices instead, you may specify their serial numbers:
```groovy
spoon {
  devices = ['333236E9AE5800EC']
}
```
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR
You can specify device Id on runtime too:
```
gradle spoon -PdeviceId=333236E9AE5800EC
```
(this way you can run tests for different variants **Parallely** on different devices)
***

It is also allowed to specify specify size of tests that should be run. You may run all the tests
annotated as `@SmallTest` with the following line:
```bash
gradle spoonSmall
```
Run `gradle tasks` for details about size rules.


You may also setup your project to take parameters for class/method to be run from command line. E.g.:

```bash
gradle spoon -PspoonClassName=fully.qualified.TestCase
```

And project configuration:

```groovy
spoon {
  if (project.hasProperty('spoonClassName')) {
    className = project.spoonClassName  
  }
}
```

Test Sharding
-------------
You can configure test sharding using the `numShards` and `shardIndex` properties 
([documentation](https://developer.android.com/tools/testing-support-library/index.html#ajur-sharding)):
```groovy
spoon {
  numShards = 4
  shardIndex = 0
}
```

Custom instrumentation arguments
--------------------------------
Use the `instrumentationArgs` property on `spoon` extension to pass custom parameters to your tests:
```groovy
spoon {
  instrumentationArgs = ["foo=bar", "name=value"]
}
```

Known issues
------------
If you have troubles with running Android Lint after this plugin is applied, try the following workaround
```groovy
buildscript {
  // ...
  dependencies {
    classpath('com.stanfy.spoon:spoon-gradle-plugin:1.0.2') {
      exclude module: 'guava'
    }
    classpath 'com.google.guava:guava:17.0'
  }
}
```
You can find details in the [related issue](https://github.com/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin/issues/33).

Testing
-------
After making editions, run
```
./gradlew integrationTest
```
This will install the plugin to local maven repo and run spoon task in the example project.
